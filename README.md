# GameCritic

GameCritic is positioned as a review aggregator web-application about videogames. It will include latest news and all relevant information about video games.

## API

In my application I will use IGDB API. IGDB API is free and provides all needed information about more 192,000 video games including rate, description, screenshots and more. IGDB is free for both non-commercial and commercial use.

## Functionality

All users could be able to search for any game they want to know about and find out things like critics' and players' rates, description, screenshots and trailers, available platforms, etc. Moreover, players could inspect game studios' (their history and games)

## Pages 

- Main page with latest news and latest game releases with their scores
- List of all games page
- List of all game studios page
- Page for video game

**Maybe some new pages will be added later**
